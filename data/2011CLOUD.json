In the midst of this hype, it is easy to overlook the fundamental change that is occurring. Computation, which used to be confined to the machine beside your desk, is increasingly centralized in vast shared facilities and at the same time liberated by battery-powered, wireless devices. Performance, security, and reliability are no longer problems that can be considered in isolation &#8211; the wires and software connecting pieces offer more challenges and opportunities than components themselves. The eXtreme Computing Group (XCG) in Microsoft Research is taking a holistic approach to research in this area, by bring together researchers and developers with expertise in data center design, computer architecture, operating systems, computer security, programming language, mobile computation, and user interfaces to tackle the challenges of cloud computing."

            "Abstract": "The creation, analysis, and dissemination of data have become profoundly democratized. Social networks spanning 100&#8217;s of millions of users enable instantaneous discussion, debate, and information sharing. Streams of tweets, blogs, photos, and videos identify breaking events faster and in more detail than ever before. Deep, on-line datasets enable analysis of previously unreachable information. This sea change is the result of a confluence of Information Technology advances such as: intensively networked systems, cloud computing, social computing, and pervasive devices and communication. \n\nThe key challenge is that the massive scale and diversity of this continuous flood of information breaks our existing technologies. State-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms do not scale to massive data sets. Existing data analytics frameworks cope poorly with incomplete and dirty data and cannot process heterogeneous multi-format information. Current large-scale processing architectures struggle with diversity of programming models and job types and do not support the rapid marshalling and unmarshalling of resources to solve specific problems. All of these limitations lead to a Scalability Dilemma: beyond a point, our current systems tend to perform worse as they are given more data, more processing resources, and involve more people &#8212; exactly the opposite of what should happen. \n\nTo address these issues, a group of us from machine learning, systems, databases, and networking just started a new five-year research effort called the AMPLab, where AMP stands for &#8220;Algorithms, Machines, and People&#8221;. AMPLab envisions a world where massive data, cloud computing, communication and people resources can be continually, flexibly and dynamically be brought to bear on a range of hard problems by huge numbers of people connected to the cloud via mobile and other client devices of increasing power and sophistication. The Founding Sponsors of the AMPLab are Google and SAP. Amazon Web Services, Cloudera, Ericsson, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, NetApp, Splunk, and VMWare are also sponsors. \n\nIn this talk, Michael Franklin will give an overview of the AMPLab motivation and research agenda and discuss several of our initial projects. One such project, CrowdDB, is developing infrastructure to support hybrid cloud/crowd query answering systems - leveraging the very different skills, and performance, reliability, and cost characteristics of large groups of machines and large groups of people."

Climate change and increasing population are further complicating watershed-scale prediction by placing additional stress and uncertainty on future hydrologic system conditions. New data collection and management approaches are allowing models to capture water flow through built and natural environments at an increasing level of detail. A significant barrier to advancing hydrologic science and water resource management is insufficient computational infrastructure to leverage these existing and future data resources within simulation models. \n\nWe have recently been awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) &#8220;Computing in the Cloud&#8221; grant to advance hydrologic science and water resource management by leveraging cloud computing for modeling large watershed systems. We will use Windows Azure in three ways. First, we will create a cloud-enabled hydrologic model. Second, we will improve the process of hydrologic model parameterization by creating cloud-based data processing workflows. Third, in Windows Azure, we will apply the model and data processing tool to a large watershed in order to address a relevant hydrologic research question related to quantifying impacts of climate change on water resources. \n\nIn this talk, we first give an overview of our project. Then, we present the specifics of how we intend to use Windows Azure and discuss issues that we anticipate will arise as we pursue the goals of our research project."

            "Abstract": "Although tremendous advances have been made in identifying the gene-coding DNA sequences in bacterial genomes using computational methods, our understanding of regulatory DNA sequences is very limited due to the lack of efficient computational methods for predicting them. Regulatory sequences specify when, how much, and where the genes should be expressed in the cell through their interactions with small proteins called transcription factors (TFs). Therefore, identifying these sequences, also called TF binding sites (TFBS), in a genome is as important as identifying gene-coding sequences for understanding the biology of the cell. Rapid recent advances in genome sequencing technology are dramatically reducing the time and cost of sequencing a genome. Over 1,500 bacterial genomes have been sequenced and this number is rising exponentially. Our very limited understanding of the gene regulatory systems in sequenced prokaryotic genomes has largely hindered our understanding of their biology and applications in renewable energy production and environment protection as well as the prevention of the diseases they cause. To fill in this gap, we have recently developed an efficient and accurate algorithm for predicting TFBSs in a group of related genomes, and have parallelized it on an in-house cluster using MPI. Although this algorithm can potentially predict TFBSs in a few thousand genomes, its capability will soon be dwarfed by the sequencing of hundreds of thousands genomes as a result of the on going world-wide efforts to sample various microbiomes using new sequencing technologies. Cloud computing holds promise to overcome the computational and storage challenges for predicting TFBSs in all sequenced genomes in the future. I will present our preliminary results to port our algorithm on the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform as an attempt to achieve such a goal."

            "Abstract": "Creating a large, dynamic database that integrates transportation data from multiple sources is unprecedented. While there are many examples of university&#8208;based programs that archive data from the state highway system (e.g. University of California, University of Virginia) and use the data for traffic management research, typically these databases consist of one type of transportation data and are small in size. The University of Southern California (USC) with Microsoft have taken the great challenge to develop the data management and analytics means that will constitute the building of a large&#8208;scale transportation data warehouse for heterogeneous transportation data (e.g., traffic flows, recorded by loop detectors; police reports; videos and images; and operational public transit data, such as passenger counts or buses&#8217; locations), which is collected from all transportation agencies in Southern California. \n\nThe collection of the traffic data, its refinement as well as the required geostreaming queries are implemented on Microsoft&#8217;s StreamInsight. Then the data is saved to Azure Tables storage space. In order to allow processing of queries to such large data set efficiently, the data is aggregated to support predefined set of spatial and temporal queries. A StreamInsight server, which resides on the Azure AppFabric, handles this aggregation process. The sketches are then written to SQLAzure. Other than infrastructural benefits, this eliminates communication and data&#8208;transfer costs to a cloud storage platform. \n\nThe wide and flexible range of storage&#8208;offers, made by Windows and SQL Azure, as well as the desire to guarantee reduced system cost for end&#8208;corporate&#8208;users, call for finding a cost&#8208;efficient blend of storage infrastructures which are well tuned for consistency and concurrency requirements of our data&#8208;intensive sensor&#8208;network application. Utilizing this whole set of technologies can bring even more profit to the data owner, in case a decision is made to make it available through the Microsoft Data Market."

            "Abstract": "Recent advances in sensing and software technologies enable us to obtain large-scale, yet fine 3D mesh models of cultural heritage assets such as old statues, buildings, and entire excavation sites. By using latest laser range sensors specialized for various environments, and sophisticated parallel computing techniques, we can construct high definition 3D models of those precious objects easily and quickly. Such archived data can be utilized for many kinds of purposes, such as archaeology, education, and entertainment. However, such large 3D models cannot be accessed interactively from general users through the Internet because of the limitation of the computer performance and network bandwidth. Cloud computing technology is a solution that can process a very large amount of information without adding to each client user&#8217;s processing cost. In this presentation, we propose an interactive display and sharing system for large 3D mesh models, stored on a remote environment through a network of relatively small capacity machines, based on the cloud computing concept. Our system uses both model- and image-based rendering methods for efficient load balance between a server and clients. On the server, the 3D models are rendered by the model-based method using a hierarchical data structure with Level of Detail (LOD). On the client, an arbitrary view is constructed by using a novel image-based method, referred to as the Grid-Lumigraph, which blends colors from sampling images received from the server. The resulting rendering system can efficiently render any images in real time. We implemented the system and evaluated the rendering and data transferring performance."

These indices enable TSUBAKI to capture the semantic matching between a given query and documents more precisely and flexibly. \n\nAmong these various relations, case/ellipsis relations have not been indexed in a large scale. This is mainly because the speed of these analyses is not fast enough due to the necessity of referring to a large database of predicateargument patterns, which is automatically acquired from a large corpus. Thus, we apply case/ellipsis analysis to a huge Web corpus by using the cloud computing environment of Azure. \n\nTo apply case/ellipsis analysis to millions of Web pages of TSUBAKI in a practical time, it is necessary to use the order of 10,000 CPU cores. To use 10,000 CPU cores on Azure, it is required to create 29 hosted services of 350 CPU cores due to the limitation of Azure. Each service analyzes Web pages using a master/worker model. In this model, a master manages workers, which concurrently apply our analysis to an input file. This concurrent execution does not need reciprocal communication and can be performed independently. \n\nWe implemented the above framework and tested our analysis on 1x350, 2x350 and 8x350 step by step. Finally, we confirmed that we can obtain 29x350 CPU cores and execute our analysis on these CPU cores. Our future work is to run the online search process of TSUBAKI on Azure in addition to the offline indexing process."

            "Abstract": "A typical transport supply chain in Australian coal industry involves multiple independent business entities that own different resources. For example, the Hunter Valley Coal Chain (HVCC) is the Worlds largest coal export operation, which consists of 35 coal mines owned by 14 producers, 24 load points, 28 trains run by 2 rail operators, tracks own by 2 operators and 2 coal port terminals. The producers and operators are independent and they contract with each other to ensure the transportation resources (trucks, trains, rails, ports etc.) for shipping the coal. As individually negotiated contracts may not lead to an optimal (sometimes even not feasible) resource usage in the whole coal chain, a coordinator&#8217;s role is needed to efficiently run the coal chain. However, there are obstacles to establish such a role because participants need to make some sensitive information available to the coordinator. The current coal chain practices do not guarantee that the information won&#8217;t flow to the competitors of the information provider and convincing miners and operators to share information is difficult. \n\nWe are developing a cloud-based system to address this issue. The coordinator is hosted in an external party managed platform (offered by an infrastructure as a service) provider such as Microsoft Azure. The system ensures that shared information is only used by the coordinator for the purpose specified by participants. The system states are monitored by participants to ensure compliance. The system requires the implementation of high throughput logging and runtime anomaly detection mechanism. We will report our progress in this talk."

Since the winter of 2006 &#8211; 2007, overwintering honeybee colonies in the US have died in large numbers. Affected beekeepers span the entire spectrum of the industry: migratory beekeepers to stationary beekeepers; and commercial beekeepers, parttime beekeepers, to backyard beekeepers. If the observed losses continue, they threaten not only the livelihoods of beekeepers who manage bees, but the livelihood of farmers who require bees to pollinate their crops and the food supply from those crops. \n\nHive Tracks, www.hivetracks.com , and The Bee Informed Partnership www.beeinformed.org ,are two current projects using cloud based solutions to help beekeepers make better hive management decisions. Hive Tracks is a web based record keeping service for beekeepers to assist them in efficient and effective management of their honeybee colonies. The Bee Informed Partnership is a survey based project that uses beekeepers&#8217; real world experience to solve beekeepers&#8217; real world problems. Through several tiers of increasingly detailed data collection on hive management practices and bee health, this project will adapt the tools developed by human epidemiologists to study honey bee colony health. Its focus will be to identify management practices that keep colonies alive and findings will be shared rapidly, transparently, and in ways that will enable beekeepers to make informed individualized decisions. Data collection, entry, analysis, and dissemination will all be done in the cloud. An overview of the two projects along with a vision for their future growth will be presented."

Beyond the well-established benefits such as the massive scalability of both compute on demand and storage on demand, cloud computing offers the ability to think differently about the problems we aretrying to solve. Rather than facing constraints of fixed limitations of a target computational platform, we are able to develop codes and algorithms that can make intelligent use of the resources available. A particular code may begin to solve a problem on a modest set of hardware and then, as the incoming data set grows or solution evolves, issue calls to the underlying cloud infrastructure to allocate the appropriate increase in hardware. The software can then reconfigure its control structures to accommodate the newly acquired hardware and resume the task of solving the problem at hand. \n\nThis talk will discuss early progress in the application of the above techniques to a document clustering algorithm developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The original codes used to solve this problem utilize a memory resident non-binary tree, which causes the problem size to be limited by the amount of physical ram in the machine. The application of the cloud and the techniques described in this talk are allowing the algorithm to span multiple machines in a self-scaling, fault tolerant manner. This talk will provide initial results, lessons learned, future work, as well as a brief comments on utilizing various cloud vendors for the same code base."

Overall, it has enabled numerous e-Science applications in important domains, including Chemistry and Physics, Medical and Life Sciences, Engineering and Design, Economics and Finance, Environmental Science, and Earth Sciences and Astronomy etc. Nimrod not only provides a framework that allows users to express the built-in parallelism in their applications, but it also enables users to take advantage of the large-scale distributed resources in the Cloud without worrying about difficult issues such as scalability, fault tolerance, performance, resource management and the different abstraction layers of Cloud. \n\nWe are currently porting the Nimrod &#8220;Agent&#8221; to Azure, which is responsible for spawning computations on Cloud resources. It actually represents the minimum amount of Nimrod that needs to run under Azure. After that, we will implement a runtime system outside Azure, including a job scheduler, monitor, resource manager and Web portal. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution we plan two significant case studies. One, Ceniza, in conjunction with Instituto Tecnol&#243;gico de Costa Rica, models ash dispersion from a volcanic eruption. This time consuming computation is important in planning infrastructure in urban areas affected by volcanic ash. Another, iGrid, with University of Queensland in the area of energy economics, investigates the role of smart-grids and electricalgeneration distribution in lowering Australia&#8217;s carbon emissions. Again, this computationally expensive application will allow the comparison of different generation strategies, including mixes of solar, wind and traditional capabilities. Together these applications will stress the Nimrod implementation on Azure, but will also provide interesting scientific results."

            "Abstract": "Although multiple enterprise applications have made effective use of Clouds, the barriers to the development of large-scale high-performance scientific applications that can utilize Clouds in an extensible and scalable fashion remain high. Developing logically and/or physically distributed applications at large-scales is fundamentally a difficult undertaking; developing them for emerging platforms such as Clouds is made harder due to the lack of commonly acceptable and widely used programming models and application-level abstractions. Additionally, several of the challenges&#8212;such as coordination of multiple components, that face scientific applications on traditional distributed environments such as Grids, carry-over to cloud environments. \n\nBased upon a recently submitted paper to ACM Computing Surveys http://www.cct.lsu.edu/~sjha/select_ publications/dpa_surveypaper.pdf we present a comprehensive analysis of the usage of production distributed infrastructure, explore abstractions that exist as well as those that should be provided to better support the effective development, deployment, and execution of large-scale (scientific) high-performance applications. The advantages of such abstractions vary from better utilization of underlying resources to the greater flexibility in the deployment of applications, as well as lowered development effort. We are extending the analytical framework for logically and physically distributed applications, that was developed in the paper referenced above, to focus on Programming and Systems abstractions for Dynamic, Distributed and Data-Intensive Applications (See: http://wiki. esi.ac.uk/3DPAS). \n\nBuilding upon this understanding, we are developing and implementing multiple abstractions, and applying them to support a range of life-science applications, for example, next-generation gene sequencing analytics and ensemble-based computing for effective drug design. We present some initial implementation and proof of effectiveness of these abstractions on Azure and FutureGrid/XD. The ultimate goal of our work is to enable a wide range of existing, emerging and novel life-science applications to better and effectively utilize cloud platforms."

Magnetotellurics (MT) is a relatively new geophysical technique pioneered by our collaborators, whereby naturally occurring electromagnetic waves are used as source fields for imaging the Earth&#8217;s electrical resistivity structure at depths ranging from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometres. The random and weak nature of the excitation requires substantial processing. \n\nWe are building an Azure cloud environment as our first collaboration with geophysicists* to reduce the run time of a 3D inversion of Gawler Craton data from weeks to days. This paper discusses parallelisation of the existing inversion procedure, written as a sequential FORTRAN program, by using a parallel programming cloud framework to allocate independent computations across tens of machines. The optimisation method used in the inversion permits distribution of the workload across frequencies. Forward modeling iterations can be unwound and allocated across processors to further reduce execution time. We break down the 5.5 months effort into learning MT, FORTRAN parallelisation, and building a Web application. The next stage of our collaboration will make our rapid inversion program accessible as a cloud application, available to explorers, worldwide. \n\nMotivation: As the information products of national labs and government agencies are increasingly used to make investment decisions, and as input to national policy, scientists realise that their products need to be dynamic and to encourage analysis. Our rapid inversion is our first attempt at modeling on demand for policy makers, or explorers, to analyse information products for robustness and to extend them more easily for further analysis and interpretation. Cloud computing with its universality of access, pay-per-use model, and massive storage is well matched to this need. At the discovery end, clever deployment of cloud computing in the field can combine massive historical data with real time sensing and modeling to provide unparalleled productivity increases in exploration. \n\n* Including Graham Heinson and Stephan Thiel in the Department of Geology and Geophysics in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences"

As such, it seems appropriate that students in technology related disciplines be exposed to cloud computing in their academic programs. Teaching cloud computing from a purely technological perspective is one way to expose students to cloud computing, however it does not educate students on how to recognize and exploit opportunities to leverage cloud computing to obtain operational and strategic benefits. Likewise, teaching cloud computing from a purely business perspective does not allow students to gain technical knowledge of cloud computing technology and does not expose them to the full breadth of opportunities that can be exploited using cloud computing technology. \n\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose teaching cloud computing from a problem solving perspective using the Microsoft Imagine Cup Software Design Competition as a framework to bring the cloud into the classroom. The Microsoft Imagine Cup allows students to think of innovative ways to utilize cloud computing and then gives them the opportunity to apply this thinking to the creation of an information system that runs on the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform. In our presentation, we will cover how and when cloud computing should be covered in the classroom, provide a brief introduction to the Imagine Cup and discuss its utility as a framework for teaching students about cloud computing, and share our experiences using the Imagine Cup as a way to teach students how to think innovatively about the use of cloud computing and how to turn that thinking into a working information system. Examples of past student Imagine Cup projects will be presented to illustrate the breadth of the organizational opportunities identified by students that can be exploited using cloud computing."

Above all, an explosion of data-intensive and compute-intensive applications is fueling the growth of newer computing models. The large-scale data and computational needs of these models have resulted in the emergence of cloud computing. The cloud is being promoted as the next generation computer and it is imperative that we introduce it to students at all levels of our curriculum. We provide practical hands-on modules to introduce cloud-computing that can be easily adopted into existing courses in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses. \n\nWe examined all the three prominent cloud models, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Google App Engine and Microsoft Azure as the framework for teaching parallelism. While all the models are powerful in their own respect, Azure abstracts all the infrastructural details to provide an intuitive model for large-volume enterprise-level application development. Our goal is to focus on teaching specific core competencies that have broad impact across STEM courses. These competencies include parallelism, algorithms for knowledge discovery, servicesoriented design, large-scale data-intensive analytics, design for high-performance and automatic load balancing, large-scale storage and monitoring for access control and performance. Some of the influential features of Azure include the development environment offered by Visual Studio with an easy access to production environment on the cloud, the role-based application modules in web-role and worker-role supporting the ease of cloudapplication development, persistence store offered by AzureSQL, blob storage for multi-media data, REST-based web services, and AppFabric for composite application development.

This analysis is unique in many respects, particularly that we designed the cloud application (&#8220;BESS&#8221;) from first principles (in Windows Azure) and then only later did we &#8220;port&#8221; it to a local cluster environment (and finally a hybrid &#8220;cloud-bursting&#8221; version).

Iterative extensions include a merge step; in-memory caching of static data (between iterations); cache aware hybrid scheduling using Azure Queues as well as a bulletin board (special table). Twister4Azure and MRRoles4Azure offer the familiar MapReduce programming model with fault tolerance features similar to traditional MapReduce and a decentralized control model without a master node implying no single point of failure.

Representatives include analytics- and simulation- driven applications such as astrophysics data analysis, bioinformatics, etc. In these fields, scientists are dealing with large amounts of data and processing (analyzing) them to explore new concepts and ideas. \n\nMany scientists are exploring the possibilities of deploying applications with large scale of data on cloud computing platforms such as Windows Azure. Recently, the successful deployment of eScience applications on clouds motivates us to deploy HPC analytics applications to the cloud, especially MapReduce enabled. The reason behind this lies in a fact that eScience applications and HPC analytics applications share some important features: tera-scale or peta-scale data size and high cost to run on single or several supercomputers or large platforms. However, HPC analytics applications bear some distinct characteristics such as complex data access patterns, interest locality, and which pose new challenges to its adoption of clouds. 1) There exists a mismatch between the high-performance requirement of HPC analytics applications on large-scale data and the tolled computation and I/O capacity in the cloud platforms due to virtualization technology; 2) There exists a &#8220;data semantics&#8221;gap between the way data was stored by the cloud platforms and the way data will be accessed by the HPC analytics applications; 3) Emerging parallel data processing models impose new design and implementation issues on the clouds, including MapReduce based and non-MapReduce based. However, current solutions do not deal well with these challenges and have several limitations. First, we examine the cloud platforms supporting Hadoop/MapReduce, such as Amazon EC2 and Open Cirrus. Although the Hadoop/MapReduce framework supports applications which operate on very large data sets, it is not designed for semantics-based HPC analytics and will suffer with limited performance. Second, we examine the cloud platforms not supporting Hadoop/MapReduce; specifically, we examine Windows Azure. Lastly, co-locating computation and storage is the most salient feature in MapReduce. Data are often prepared beforehand and evenly stored at local node where a compute task can be launched. Unfortunately, current cloud architectures and applications make it hard to implement good co-location. \n\nWe have been developing a data semantics aware framework to support HPC analytics applications on clouds. We envision better solutions in distributed and parallel file and storage systems, high-performance parallel programming APIs for big data processing, and interoperable data conversion middleware are imperatively needed. Our approach will gear toward data-semantics aware big scientific data processing. This infrastructure consists of three components; 1) a MapReduce API with data semantics awareness (MARS) to develop high-performance MapReduce applications, 2) a translation layer equipped with data-semantics aware HPC interfaces (HIAS), and 3) a neural network based Data-Affinity-Aware data placement scheme (NDAFA)."

The economic and algorithmic principles guiding the pricing of data, data products, and the services that deliver them are largely unexplored. Existing pricing frameworks are simplistic and can exhibit unexpected and undesirable properties leading to, for example, arbitrage situations, fairness violations, and unpredictability. Further, the technology to facilitate these cloud-based data markets and enforce pricing policies is underdeveloped. \n\nIn this talk, we present early work at the University of Washington related to building relational data markets in the cloud. We first discuss how one can support fine-grained data pricing efficiently, what fine-grained data pricing enables, and the properties that different pricing schemes entail. We then discuss several tools that we are currently building in support of a cloud data market. These tools include a Pricing Advisor that helps content providers price their data, a Market Monitor that observes current prices and searches for pre-defined property violations such as arbitrage opportunities, a Comparison Shopper that assess and compares the cleanliness and information content of various datasets, and more."

The elasticity of the cloud is utilized to scale the system to handle larger or smaller numbers of processing requests. Very few cloud applications are designed to handle continuous streams of data [See, for instance, refs. 1, 2, 3] and none can handle multiple, independent data inputs with multiple independent outputs. Existing systems tend to be based on MapReduce/Hadoop, require custom programming for each application and are difficult to modify, reconfigure, extend or re-use in new situations. To address these issues, we will present the preliminary implementation of an Azure cloud application that features multiple simultaneous, independent, real-time input and output endpoints. The system also designed to use drop-in processing modules that the user assembles into a processing graph to perform the desired operations. A processing graph may have multiple input endpoints of differing types to simultaneously gather information from a wide variety of sources. The user assembles the graph by selecting a module from a library and specifying the desired input and output connections. Process allocation, connection mechanics and data synchronization are handled transparently. Multiple independent output endpoints are also supported, enabling the user to simultaneously extract different processing results from a single processing graph. The user can modify, reconfigure and extend the graph without re-deploying or even stopping the system. System configurations are stored in the cloud and cloud-enabled fault tolerance is supported. Applications for this technology include environmental sensor monitoring, real-time aircraft/vehicle tracking, highway monitoring and process monitoring. \n\n[1] STREAM project (http://www.streamproject.eu) : query-based real-time processing \n\n[2] HStreaming (http://hstreaming.com): Hadoop in the cloud \n\n[3] Logothetis and Yocum, &#8220;Ad-hoc Data Processing in the Cloud&#8221; (Proc.

            "Abstract": "Applications and experiments in all areas of science are becoming increasingly complex and more demanding in terms of their computational and data requirements. Some applications generate data volumes reaching hundreds of terabytes and even petabytes. Sharing, disseminating, and analyzing these petascale data sets becomes a big challenge especially when distributed resources are used. For this purpose, we have introduced the Stork data scheduler which focuses on planning, scheduling, monitoring and management of data placement tasks and application-level end-to-end optimization of networked I/O for petascale distributed applications. Stork is considered one of the very first examples of data placement scheduling and it has been very actively used in many application areas including coastal hazard prediction, reservoir uncertainty analysis, digital sky imaging, educational video processing, numerical relativity, and multiscale computational fluid dynamics resulting in breakthrough research. \n\nAs part of our recent NSF CiC Award, we are further developing and enhancing the Stork Data Scheduler to support the Windows Azure cloud computing environment, in order to mitigate the data handling bottleneck in data intensive cloud computing applications as well. The Stork Data Scheduler for Azure will make a distinctive contribution to cloud computing environments because it implements techniques specific to queuing, scheduling, and optimization of data placement jobs; provides high reliability in data transfers; and creates a level of abstraction between the user applications and the underlying data transfer and storage resources via a modular, uniform interface. Stork data scheduler for Azure will provide enhanced functionality for cloud computing such as data aggregation and connection caching, peer-to-peer and streamed data management; early error detection, classification, and recovery in data transfers; scheduled storage management; optimal protocol tuning; and endto- end performance prediction services. Stork for Azure will change how domain scientists perform their research by rapidly facilitating sharing of experience, raw data, and results in cloud computing environments."

            "Abstract": "In this talk, we will describe our latest development effort, GXP on Azure. GXP on Azure provides users/developers with an easy-to-use environment for executing workflows on Azure. Underneath it is a more general interface for remote process invocation and management, which makes it an attractive infrastructure for cloud-backed desktop computing. Initially, GXP was designed as a parallel shell that connects multiple administrative domains. Specifically, it accommodates resources having various interfaces (SSH and diverse batch schedulers), provides users with a uniform and fast/interactive interface to these diverse resources, and frees users from installation burdens on remote hosts, which usually do not share a file system with the user&#8217;s desktop. GXP later evolved to a workflow execution system that queues and dispatches commands to remote hosts. \n\nFor workflow description, we have so far used the make. A general interface between the frontend language and execution engine (scheduler and dispatcher) has been defined and frontends based on other scripting languages are underway. Thanks to these initial design scope of harnessing resources across multiple administrative domains, it can naturally evolve to a platform encompassing cloud resources, with GXP on Azure being a specific example. It benefits end users by giving a workflow execution environment and a description language familiar to them and portable across a range of resource types. We are specifically targeting natural language processing tools and workflows developed by Tsujii et al., which we have so far been running on Linux clusters of 8,192 cores. In this talk, I will brief the relevant aspects of GXP design and talk about implementation of GXP on Azure in some depth. I also touch upon on-going research efforts towards an easy-to-use and high performance framework for data intensive computing, with GXP being one of its main components."

This includes workflows that take over 3 weeks to run on up to 100 nodes. \n\nWe have been working with chemists who use QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships) to mine experimental data for patterns that relate the chemical structure of a drug to its activity. If a successful QSAR model can be derived from the data then it can be used to focus new chemical synthesis, dramatically reducing both cost and time. \n\nA novel approach&#8211; the Discovery Bus &#8211; is used to automate the mining process, but it is computationally intensive; for one set of input data that became available, it was predicted that it would take five years to process on the original single-server implementation. We have therefore utilised cloud computing to build a scalable solution that generates results in days rather than years. This exploits the opportunities for parallelism inherent in the Discovery Bus; for example, multiple models are independently generated before the best is selected. \n\nDiscovery Bus computations are represented as workflows, and different approaches to achieving efficient scalability have been explored. In the original, all the potential parallelism inherent in the workflow was exposed to the scheduler. Unfortunately, the granularity of the parallelism was small, and so co-ordination and communication costs reduced efficiency. A recent alternative enables the user to identify those sub-workflows that should be considered as potential units of parallelism. The higher granularity results in increased efficiency. \n\nThe talk will describe our experiences in running very large workflows on Azure, comparing the results from the different approaches. In the largest run carried out, this involves efficiently scheduling 280K sub-workflows containing a total of over 2 million service executions, on up to 100 nodes."

We are extending existing efforts in building and executing meteorology models on Windows HPC Server and orchestrated through the Trident Scientific Workflow Workbench and using components of the Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery II (LEAD II) cyberinfrastructure. In collaboration with atmospheric researchers at University of Miami, we are using Windows Azure to carry out numerical storm surge ensemble runs from which storm surge predictions can be made. We are working with a probabilistic ensemble execution of the Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) storm surge prediction model. Since a typical SLOSH simulation only takes a few minutes to run on a medium-sized workstation, the generation of ensemble products that require 15,000 instances of SLOSH becomes possible on the cloud without requiring statistical approximations. The individual instances are independent so a high degree of scale-up can be achieved. We focus in particular on fault tolerant ensemble execution using Azure worker roles, orchestrated through Trident, with downstream workflow management of the data results. A single instance of a SLOSH ensemble run takes 3 GB of input and generates 8 GB of output, making it well suited to data center execution. \n\nIn this talk we discuss the framework that enables a researcher to use cloud computing resources to run ensemble simulation studies. We build on our experiences in successful deployment of the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model, WPS, and GRADS visualization toolkit on Windows HPC Server and Windows Azure. The WRF demonstration was done using the VM role support built into Windows Azure. We will discuss the infrastructure we have built to utilize Trident for large scale workflows, including Sigiri, our framework for managing interactions with Grids and Clouds."

First, we describe how the power of edge resources can play an important role in the evolving cloud ecosystem to support in-situ data processing, locality-awareness, and privacy. We present a new cloud architecture called Nebula that is fully complementary and synergistic with the commercial cloud. \n\nSecond, the emergence of global services spanning multiple data-centers poses new challenges for efficient service execution and delivery. We describe our work with a global multi-data-center MapReduce/Hadoop service that we are building. One aspect of this work is to extend the rack-awareness of HDFS to data-center awareness. This work is a first-step towards general support for data-centric global cloud services. \n\nLastly, we describe our vision of a user-centric cloud in support of mobile hand-held devices that responds to user context, preferences, and device resource availability, to improve performance, reliability, and fidelity. Our usercentric cloud model can dynamically out-source data and computation to the cloud opportunistically. This work is also exploring implicit sharing patterns across mobile users in the cloud based on social ties and shared interests/ preferences. \n\nPreliminary results for running applications in real clouds for all three areas will be presented."

At such a scale, these storage systems face two key challenges: (a) hotspots due to the dynamic popularity of stored objects and (b) high operational costs due to power and cooling. Existing storage solutions, however, are unsuitable to address these challenges because of the large number of servers and data objects. In this talk, we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of URSA, which scales to enterprise data centers and minimizes latency and bandwidth costs during system reconfiguration. Toward this goal, URSA formulates an optimization problem that selects a subset of objects from hot-spots and performs topology-aware migration to minimize reconfiguration costs. We also show that the same reconfiguration techniques can reduce power costs. Our evaluation shows URSA achieves cost-effective load balancing, is timeresponsive in computing placement decisions, e.g., about two minutes for 10k nodes and 10M objects, and provides effective power savings. This is joint work with Gae-won You (POSTECH), Navendu Jain (Microsoft Research), and Hua-jun Zeng (Microsoft)."

            "Abstract": "In a future where data will not only come from classical computing systems as it does today, but also from millions of sensors and mobile devices, the need for energy-efficient large-scale data computation will explode. Virtualized data centers facilitate higher resource utilization and energy efficiency through consolidation. However, mixing services oriented workloads with batch jobs is typically avoided due to complex interactions and widely different quality of service (QoS) requirements, resulting in low utilizations per server and high overall energy costs. We show that the state of the art techniques that focus on consolidating homogeneous workloads do not scale well for resource management with heterogeneous workloads such as services and throughput oriented batch jobs. This happens due to the contrasting requirements of these workloads in terms of both computation and QoS. We demonstrate that co-scheduling services and batch jobs provides significant opportunity for improved energy efficiency as each tends to stress different aspects of the host hardware. A new unified metric, qMIPS/Watt, is defined, that quantifies the combined efficiency in terms of work done per Joule of the heterogeneous workload combination, derated by the negative effect batch jobs have on the ability of the service jobs to meet their performance goals. This metric is used by our VM resource management framework, called Themis, to maximize energy- efficient throughput of the latter without sacrificing the service guarantees of the former by utilizing a provably stable controller. Themis&#8217; policy has been tested on state of the art servers. It outperforms prior proposed policies by up to 70% on average in work done per Joule, while meeting the response time requirements of services, and keeping average throughput of batch jobs only 7% lower than running them on a separate server."
